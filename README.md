## Node Notes

### Why use node?
- fast, efficient and highly scalable
- event driven, non-blocking I/O model
- popular in the industy
- often used with react, vue and angular

### Non-blocking I/O
- works on a single thread using non-blocking I/O calls
- it is non-blocking on a single thread because it works asynchronously


### Node's event loop
- Single threaded
supports concurrency via events and callbacks
EventsEmitter class is used to bind events and listeners

### Best types of Projects for Node
- RESP API and microservers
- REAL time services (Chat, Live updates)
- CRUD Apps (Blogs, Shopping Carts, Social Networks)
- Tools & Utilities


## Commands to run:
- `npm init` - generates a package.json file
- `npm install express` - installs a package locally
- `npm installl -g nodemon` installs a package locally
